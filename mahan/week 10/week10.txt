Week 10:
This week, I continued honing my skills in automation testing and began exploring advanced testing strategies:

Advanced Automation Testing:

Focused on learning Selenium more deeply, particularly handling dynamic web elements such as pop-ups and alerts.

Automated form submission processes for a web application, applying advanced techniques like handling iframes, multiple windows, and data-driven testing using external files (Excel/CSV).

API Testing:

Improved my API testing skills using Postman by writing more complex test cases and using environment variables to handle different testing environments.
Practiced chaining requests to simulate end-to-end API interactions and learned to automate API tests within a CI pipeline.

Reporting:

Worked with reporting tools like Allure and Extent Reports to generate detailed automation test reports, which provide better visibility of test execution and results.
