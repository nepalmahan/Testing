In the final week of this cycle, I shifted focus to interview preparation and revision:

Interview Preparation:
Compiled a list of common interview questions for software testers, covering both manual and automated testing.
Practiced answering questions related to test case design, defect lifecycle, automation tools, and Agile methodologies.
Reviewed key testing concepts such as functional, non-functional, regression, and security testing.
Focused on explaining practical experiences from my testing journey, including the tools and methodologies I used, to ensure clear and confident responses during interviews.
